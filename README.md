This algorithm was developed from the basis set forth in Bonin et al. (2018):
Doppler Lidar Observations of the Mixing Height in Indianapolis Using an Automated Composite Fuzzy Logic Approach
Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology, 35(3), 473-490. https://doi.org/10.1175/JTECH-D-17-0159.1

The CLAMPS platform is maintained by a collaborative team at the University of Oklahoma and the NOAA National Severe Storms Laboratory. You can learn more about CLAMPS, the instruments onboard, contacts, and more at https://apps.nssl.noaa.gov/CLAMPS/

While the algorithm was developed for Doppler wind lidar and AERI retrieval profiles, it could likey be adapted for other combinations of boundary layer wind and thermodynamic profile observations.
